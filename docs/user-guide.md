# Using Mysos

Mysos provides a REST API for creating and managing MySQL clusters on Mesos.

## Dashboard
- HTTP Method: `GET`
- Path:  `/`

The root of API endpoint is a web page that lists the managed MySQL clusters.

## Creating a MySQL cluster
- HTTP Method: `POST`
- Path: `/clusters/<cluster_name>`


### Parameters
- `cluster_name`: Name of the cluster.
- `cluster_user`: The user account for all MySQL instances in the cluster which as full admin
privileges.
- `num_nodes`: Number of nodes in the cluster. [default: 3]
- `backup_id`: An ID for the MySQL backup to restore from when the MySQL instance starts. If not
specified, Mysos will start an empty MySQL instance. The format and meaning of `backup_id` is
specific to the implementation of `BackupStore` that the Mysos cluster uses.

`cluster_name` is part of the path and the rest of the parameters are specified as form fields.


### Response
A JSON object with the following fields:

- `cluster_password`: The password for accessing the MySQL instance (associated with `cluster_user`).
- `cluster_url`: A URL to the ZooKeeper group for discovering the MySQL instances of this cluster.
See the *Service Discovery* section below.


### Example
```
# Create a cluster named 'test_cluster3' and restore from the backup 'foo/bar:201503122000'.
curl -X POST 192.168.33.7/clusters/test_cluster3 --form "cluster_user=mysos" --form "num_nodes=2" --form "num_nodes=2" --form "backup_id=foo/bar:201503122000"
# Response
{"cluster_password": "w9gMCkecsMh6sWsRdxNTa", "cluster_url": "zk://mysos:mysos@192.168.33.7:2181/mysos/discover/test_cluster3"}
```

### Notes
- Cluster creation is asynchronous. The API call returns (with status 200) as soon as the Mysos
scheduler has accepted the request. The same goes for cluster deletion.
- ZooKeeper `<cluster_url>/master` sub-group has at most one ZNode which is the master of the MySQL
cluster.
- ZooKeeper `<cluster_url>/slaves` sub-group can have multiple ZNodes which are the slaves of the
MySQL cluster.
- A ZNode is added to the ZooKeeper group when the instance becomes available and ready to serve
traffic.

## Removing a MySQL cluster
- HTTP Method: `DELETE`
- Path: `/clusters/<cluster_name>`

### Parameters
- `cluster_name`: Name of the cluster.
- `password`: The password for the cluster returned by cluster creation call.

### Response
A JSON object with:

- `cluster_url`: A URL to the ZooKeeper group to watch for the termination of the cluster. The group
 ZNode is removed from ZooKeeper when the MySQL cluster is removed/terminated.

### Example
```
# Remove a cluster named 'test_cluster3'
curl -X DELETE 192.168.33.7/cluster/test_cluster3 --form "password=w9gMCkecsMh6sWsRdxNTa"
# Response
{"cluster_url": "zk://mysos:mysos@192.168.33.7:2181/mysos/discover/test_cluster3"}
```

## Service Discovery
Mysos' service discovery with ZooKeeper conforms to the ServerSet protocol. Each MySQL instance is
represented by a ZNode with its data being a
[ServiceInstance](https://github.com/twitter/commons/blob/master/src/thrift/com/twitter/thrift/endpoint.thrift)
serialized into JSON.

- The `Endpoint serviceEndpoint` field in ServiceInstance has the `host` and `port` that MySQL
client can connect to.
- Some utilities for watching ZooKeeper and parsing the `ServiceInstance`s:
