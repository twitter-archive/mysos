Place any bleeding edge versions of packages here so that they may be picked up by tox during
testing.

This is also the place for the required mesos.native packages because they are platform specific.
Put one for your development platform here for unit tests and a Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) version for
Vagrant tests.
