# Mysos
Mysos is an Apache Mesos framework for running MySQL instances. It is also being [proposed as a project in the Apache Incubator](https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/MysosProposal).

## Documentation
For convenience of getting started locally, there is a vagrant file which can be executed by running `vagrant up` on your local machine. A [user guide](docs/user-guide.md) is also available. Documentation improvements are always welcome, so please send patches our way.

## Getting Involved
The project maintains an IRC channel, `#mysos` on irc.freenode.net
